Quick Tip (Align The Repo Cards)
You usually won't be able to layout the images side by side. To do that you can use this approach:

<a href="https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats">
  <img align="center" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=anuraghazra&repo=github-readme-stats" />
</a>
<a href="https://github.com/anuraghazra/convoychat">
  <img align="center" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=anuraghazra&repo=convoychat" />
</a>
Deploy on your own Vercel instance

Since the GitHub API only allows 5k requests per hour, my https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api could possibly hit the rate limiter. If you host it on your own Vercel server, then you don't have to worry about anything. Click on the deploy button to get started!

NOTE: Since #58 we should be able to handle more than 5k requests and have no issues with downtime :D

üíñ Support the project

However, if you are using this project and are happy with it or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it :-

Giving proper credit when you use github-readme-stats on your readme, linking back to it :D
